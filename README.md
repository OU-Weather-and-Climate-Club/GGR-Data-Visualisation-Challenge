# Greenhouse Gas Removals Data Visualisation Challenge

***
## Summary 
A coding club challenge for data visualizations that encourage creative engagement with Greenhouse Gas Removals (GGR) research. 

This challenge was inspired by the [9 ways to remove carbon dioxide from the air](https://co2re.org/9-ways-to-remove-carbon-dioxide-from-the-air/) story publication by CO2RE and Imperial College London, exploring a range of techniques to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air. Written by George Hope and Philippa Westbury, it references some of the CO2RE project demonstrators who are at the forefront of the field.

The 9 ways covered are:
1. Protect and restore peatlands
2. Use machines to capture COâ‚‚ from the air
3. Harness the power of the ocean
4. Create and manage woodlands
5. Make biochar and use it in agriculture
6. Use wood in construction
7. Crush basalt from quarries and add it to soil
8. Change agricultural practices to improve soils
9. Grow crops for energy and store the COâ‚‚

Choosing from any of the 9 areas or its associated projects as a starting point, the challenge is to
- create a data visualisation that explores an area of GGR research
- reflect on storytelling techniques for better scientific communication

Submissions will be showcased by the club throughout the year in a website gallery, in individual write ups and on environmental days of awareness. 

Submissions from beginners are just as welcome as submissions from more experienced coders! 

If you are a beginner you will inspire other beginners and learn in a supportive environment ðŸ™‚ 

To help you get started you can find more info and resources in our [wiki](https://github.com/OU-Weather-and-Climate-Club/GGR-Data-Visualisation-Challenge/wiki), where you will find a road map and pages exploring each of the possible topics. Also see below for more on using story maps to share the message of your visualisation.

## CO2RE and the importance of GGR

- CO2RE is the UKâ€™s national multidisciplinary research hub on Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR): [Introducing CO2RE, The Greenhouse Gas Removal Hub](https://youtu.be/SyjNxKmq8cE?si=nNH0v-LOdKVBYttE) (2 min video)

The documentation for a recent CO2RE initiative funding creative projects on GRR communication helps answer the following questions: 

**Why is GGR important?** 

*"The Special Report on 1.5Â°C by the IPCC3, concludes that we will require between 100â€“1000 billion
tonnes (or Gigatonnes â€“ Gt) of CO2 removal (or its equivalent) by 2100*

*The scale of this challenge is huge, currently, only 0.002 GtCO2 of GGR per year results from novel
engineered approaches*

*Within the UK, the national Net Zero Strategy, â€˜Build Back Betterâ€™5, has set ambitious targets for GGR.
For example, the Strategy states that by 2050 between 75 and 81 million tons of CO2 per year of
residual emissions will need to be removed using engineered techniques (p.180). This means the
equivalent of between 45 and 80% of the UKâ€™s current total annual greenhouse gas emissions will need
to be removed, within the next 26-years.*

*The required GGR industry currently barely exists yet it will need to scale to multi-trillions in annual
revenue globally, and multi-billions in the UK, within two decades. This is an unprecedented challenge."*

**Why is the communication of GGR important?**

*"Currently, public awareness of GGR â€“ what it is, its challenges and opportunities â€“ is very low. There is
minimal public discourse about GGR and publics are, currently, playing minimal roles in the national
social, economic and policy debates. We believe that this lack of awareness and engagement needs to
be addressed, if GGR targets and a safe climate are to be achieved."*

p6, https://co2re.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Final-Text-Artists-Arts-and-Humanities-Initiative-27062024.pdf

**Why is collaboration between the arts and climate science important?**

*"We believe science and engineering, including their conceptualisation, design and delivery; as well as
the innovations that follow, are cultural practices. This means that artists, creative practitioners and
the arts and humanities (ACAH) have a key role to play in their delivery."*

## Encouraging collaboration between the arts and climate science via story maps

We are really interested in supporting students feature their visualisations in a story map, sometimes also known as a scrollytelling article. 

Story maps combine maps, narrative text, images and multimedia into interactive, visual narratives. Story maps are particularly good at communicating scientific data to a citizen audience and creating personalised storytelling through user interaction. You can find some examples of story maps in the gallery below and on our topic wiki pages.  

Story maps would be a brilliant way to work with the OU digital arts community, and get students learning from each other across disciplines the skills of being better scientific communicators.

## Getting started using story maps

If you've never seen a story map, this gallery will give you a good sense of the possibilities:

- [NOAA Story Map Inspiration Gallery](https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MinimalGallery/index.html?appid=e02942a8cdeb45348c69184539a7e705)

- [StoryMapJs](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) is a free browser-based easy-to-use tool for creating story maps.

For a tutorial to help you get started, the Digital Humanities Initiative has created this very comprehensive tutorial ðŸ‘‡

- Bog Day, 4th Sunday of July 

Topic: **Oceans**
