# Greenhouse Gas Removals Data Visualisation Challenge

***

## **Idea in Progress**: 
A coding club challenge for data visualizations that encourage creative engagement with Greenhouse Gas Removals (GGR) research. 

This challenge was inspired by the [9 ways to remove carbon dioxide from the air](https://co2re.org/9-ways-to-remove-carbon-dioxide-from-the-air/) story publication by CO2RE and Imperial College London, exploring a range of techniques to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air. Written by George Hope and Philippa Westbury, it references some of the CO2RE project demonstrators who are at the forefront of the field.

The 9 ways covered are:
1. Protect and restore peatlands
2. Use machines to capture COâ‚‚ from the air
3. Harness the power of the ocean
4. Create and manage woodlands
5. Make biochar and use it in agriculture
6. Use wood in construction
7. Crush basalt from quarries and add it to soil
8. Change agricultural practices to improve soils
9. Grow crops for energy and store the COâ‚‚

Choosing from any of the 9 areas or its associated projects as a starting point, the challenge is to
- create a data visualisation that explores an area of GGR research
- reflect on storytelling techniques for better scientific communication

Submissions will be showcased by the club throughout the year in a website gallery and in individual write ups. 

Submissions from beginners are just as welcome as submissions from more experienced coders! 

If you are a beginner you will inspire other beginners and learn in a supportive environment ðŸ™‚

## CO2RE and the importance of GGR

- CO2RE is the UKâ€™s national multidisciplinary research hub on Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR): [Introducing CO2RE, The Greenhouse Gas Removal Hub](https://youtu.be/SyjNxKmq8cE?si=nNH0v-LOdKVBYttE) (2 min video)

This is a recent summary of GGR policy in the UK:

*"The Special Report on 1.5Â°C by the IPCC3, concludes that we will require between 100â€“1000 billion
tonnes (or Gigatonnes â€“ Gt) of CO2 removal (or its equivalent) by 2100*

*The scale of this challenge is huge, currently, only 0.002 GtCO2 of GGR per year results from novel
engineered approaches*

*Within the UK, the national Net Zero Strategy, â€˜Build Back Betterâ€™5, has set ambitious targets for GGR.
For example, the Strategy states that by 2050 between 75 and 81 million tons of CO2 per year of
residual emissions will need to be removed using engineered techniques (p.180). This means the
equivalent of between 45 and 80% of the UKâ€™s current total annual greenhouse gas emissions will need
to be removed, within the next 26-years.*

*The required GGR industry currently barely exists yet it will need to scale to multi-trillions in annual
revenue globally, and multi-billions in the UK, within two decades. This is an unprecedented challenge."*
